#mangoext

A very simple Chrome extension to read mango chapters without clicking.

## Features

 * Loads images in a single strip as you scroll
 * Fixes link styles: visited links are purple, unvisited links are blue
   (useful for tracking progress)
 * Removes clutter
 * Left/right arrow keys change chapters

## Supported sites

 * mangoreader.net
 * mangofox.me
 * bato.to

Suggestions are welcome.

Some sites, such as [Kissmango](http://kissmanga.com/), have the long-strip
feature built-in so mangoext is not required.

## Installation

Install the extension from its **[Chrome Web Store](https://goo.gl/7kXexb)** page.

## Changing permissions

Updating the extension to add support for additional sites will result in
the extension being auto-disabled by Chrome due to changing permissions.
The Chrome menu will have an option to re-enable the extension after it's disabled.
